# flower102classifier
I have been working on this project since August 0f 2023. I'm happy that i could get the classifier accuracy more than 80%. there are 3 main fies in this repository. i don't attach the data directory which consisit of 102 flower varities since it's more than 25Mb. i would like to give link later. @predict.py and @train.py can be accessed only from the commandline. i will provide the basic commands below. @image classifier.ipynb jupyter notebook is there to learn how to develop the model. more over it's not a model from  scratch. using the transfer learning i could get code only for the classifier. 
i will provide the further improvements below.
(This is a draft ..)
